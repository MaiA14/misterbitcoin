If you didn't sign up, this is the time. Only logged in user can see the content of other pages. There is auth guard who checks that.

My home page after I signed up:

Bitcoin rate is updated since I am using Ajax to retrieve this data, with HttpClient. According the rate I am calculating the value in bitcoins. Now I can transfer bitcoins to my contacts. Let's see my contacts :)
